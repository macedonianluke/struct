# **PROJECT CODE: VISIONARY**

### **The "Anti-Agent" Real Estate Super-App**

**Concept:** AI-Led Property Discovery & Architectural Visualization Market Network.
**Philosophy:** Ruthlessly Modular. Ultra Minimalist. Design-Led.

---

## **01. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**The Problem:**
Real estate portals (https://www.google.com/search?q=RealEstate.com.au, Domain) are static "data dumps." They sell what *is*, not what *could be*. Buyers are blind to potential. Architects are expensive and inaccessible for quick advice.

**The Solution:**
A mobile-first "Vision Engine" that lets users search properties, instantly visualize renovations using advanced AI (Nano Banana), and book "micro-consultations" with world-class architects for a reality check.

**The Hook:**
"Don't just buy a house. Buy the vision."

## **02. PRODUCT VISION & VIBE**

**The Aesthetic:**

* **Visual Language:** "Brutalist Functionalism." No "vibe coding" (no cutesy gradients or rounded playful buttons). Sharp lines, monochrome UI, high-contrast typography. The images provide the color.
* **Interaction:** Fast, sticky, addictive. Think "TikTok for Property Potential." Infinite scroll of homes in your area, but every image auto-generates a "Potential" overlay.

**The "Anti-Gravity" Build:**

* **Code Philosophy:** We do not write boilerplate. We use **Google Antigravity** (Agentic IDE) to orchestrate AI agents that build the code.
* **Stack:**
* **Frontend:** Flutter or React Native (Single codebase for iOS/Android).
* **AI Core:** Nano Banana (Gemini Image 3) for visualization + ControlNet for structural integrity.
* **Backend:** Python/FastAPI (Microservices architecture).

## **03. KEY FEATURES (THE USER JOURNEY)**

### **Phase 1: The Search (The Hook)**

* **Geo-Fenced Discovery:** User opens app. It immediately scans their current location (or target zone) for listings.
* **Data Scrape:** Pulls live data (images, floor plans, zoning/usage "busage" constraints) from portals.
* **The "Dream" Toggle:**
* *Default View:* The ugly brown carpet 1980s living room.
* *Vision View:* User taps a style filter (e.g., "Japandi," "Industrial," "Mid-Century"). The AI (Nano Banana) instantly re-renders the room while keeping walls/windows in place.



### **Phase 2: The Reality Check (The Moat)**

* **Micro-Consulting Marketplace:**
* User loves a property but wonders, "Can I actually knock down this wall?" or "Is this site usage allowed for a duplex?"
* **The "Ask an Architect" Button:**
* User pays a flat fee (e.g., $200) for a 30-minute "Micro-Report" or video call.
* **The Expert:** A qualified architect/designer reviews the listing and the AI image. They don't draw full plans; they give high-value *advice* (e.g., "Great vibe, but that's a load-bearing wall, will cost $20k to remove").



### **Phase 3: The Consultant Loop**

* **Consultant Dashboard:** Architects get a "Gig Feed." They see a property, the user's AI vision, and the brief. They accept the job, drop a 300-word expert opinion or a marked-up image, and get paid.
* **Prompt Refining:** Architects can also sell "Professional Prompts"—expertly crafted AI instructions that users can buy to get better image results.

## **04. BUSINESS MODEL**

**We do not sell to Real Estate Agents.** (They are one-and-done transactional).
**We sell to the "Property Obsessed."** (They look every week).

**1. B2C Subscription ("Visionary Pro"):**

* **Free Tier:** 3 searches/day, standard AI speed.
* **Pro Tier ($29/mo):** Unlimited AI renders, higher resolution, "Busage" (Zoning/Usage) Deep Data integration, save unlimited projects.

**2. Marketplace Fees:**

* **Consultation:** User pays $200. Architect gets $160. Platform takes $40 (20%).
* **Why Architects love it:** No client acquisition costs. No long meetings. Just pure high-value advice in spare time.

---

## **05. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (THE "RUTHLESS" BUILD)**

*Designed for modularity. If a better AI model comes out, we hot-swap it.*

**1. The Scraper Service (Python):**

* Monitors major real estate portals.
* **"Busage" Integration:** Cross-references listings with Council/Government zoning maps (usage rights, heritage overlays).

**2. The Vision Service (Nano Banana + ControlNet):**

* **Input:** Original Listing Photo + User Prompt (Style) + Architect Constraint (optional).
* **Processing:** Edge detection ensures we don't hallucinate windows where walls exist. Nano Banana applies the texture/lighting/furniture style.
* **Output:** High-res "After" shot.

**3. The Marketplace Service:**

* Stripe Connect for split payments.
* Chat/Video interface for the 30-min consult.

## **06. STRATEGIC ROADMAP**

**Phase 1: The "Toy" (Months 1-3)**

* **Goal:** Virality.
* **Build:** Mobile Web App (PWA).
* **Feature:** Search + AI Image Reskin.
* **Marketing:** "Look what this dump could look like." Share generated images on Instagram/TikTok.

**Phase 2: The "Tool" (Months 3-6)**

* **Goal:** Retention & Revenue.
* **Build:** Native App (iOS/Android).
* **Feature:** Add the "Architect Marketplace." Onboard 50 high-quality designers (curated, not open to everyone).
* **Data:** Integrate "Busage" (Zoning/Usage) data overlays.

**Phase 3: The "Brain" (Months 6+)**

* **Goal:** Deep Tech Defensibility.
* **Feature:** Long-term AI training.
* **Identity:** Users upload *their* furniture or style preferences. The AI learns "User A likes concrete floors" and auto-applies it to every house they view.
* **Fine-Tuning:** Use the Architects' feedback to fine-tune the AI model (e.g., if an architect flags an image as "structurally impossible," the AI learns not to do that again).

## **07. WHY THIS WINS**

1. **Sticky:** People browse property for fun. We make it 10x more fun.
2. **High Trust:** We aren't trying to sell the house (like an agent). We are selling the *truth* about the house (via the architect).
3. **Scalable Supply:** Architects are underpaid and overworked. They crave high-hourly-rate, low-commitment side gigs.
4. **Low Code:** Built using Antigravity and off-the-shelf models, overhead is near zero.
